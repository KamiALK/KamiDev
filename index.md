# kafka-server

In this project, various technologies come together, including the well-known message broker Kafka, along with three backend projects:

    A video and music server called Plex, deployed using Docker.
    A WhatsApp bot that sends and receives messages through Kafka.
    A Python project that downloads YouTube videos and organizes them into playlists on a homemade VPS.

Additionally, we have a feature where one backend bot can control the behavior of another backend, written in a different language, through Kafka. There's also another bot, a homemade LLM using Ollama Phi 3, which is still under development, designed to answer specific documentation queries.
