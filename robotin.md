## Introduction

My curiosity led me to explore the scope of programming, and I realized it can solve very everyday problems. A colleague who owned a restaurant struggled with displaying orders to customers, which prompted me to research how to do it. I credit the person I saw doing it, Leifer MÃ©ndez, who created a library. I simply added the logic to make it work.

## considerations

The basis of this project is ease of use, for which it is linked to a Google spreadsheet. This requires having an account and being able to use the Google Cloud Console.

In addition to being able to use the console, you need to have the Google Sheets API enabled and configured in your credentials.

In addition, you need to configure the credentials in service account mode so that the project can connect and have read and write permissions to the spreadsheet.

You also need to obtain the spreadsheet ID and add the service account's email address as an editor and reader of the spreadsheet.
