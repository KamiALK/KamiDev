## Introduction

Developed a robust backend architecture comprising multiple services, including a WhatsApp bot that efficiently receives and processes links. This system leverages Apache Kafka for seamless communication between services, ensuring real-time data flow and responsiveness.

Designed and implemented a Python-based backend responsible for downloading videos from YouTube, enhancing media accessibility. The downloaded content is systematically organized and dispatched to a Plex media server, optimizing media management and playback.

All components are orchestrated within Docker containers, promoting a microservices architecture that ensures scalability, portability, and simplified deployment.
